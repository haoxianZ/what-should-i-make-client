# What Should I Make?

An app that allows you to write some encouragement for others and in exchange you receive a note from others. 

## Motivation

I tend to just buy what is on sale from the supermarket, so sometime I ends up with ingredients I don't really know what to do with. Now I can find new recipes for myself and try them!
